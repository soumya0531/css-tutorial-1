                A CSS (cascading style sheet) file allows you to separate your
                web sites (X)HTML content from it’s style. As always you use
                your (X)HTML file to arrange the content, but all of the
                presentation (fonts, colors, background, borders, text
                formatting, link effects &amp; so on…) are accomplished within a
                CSS.
              </p>
              <p>
                At this point you have some choices of how to use the CSS,
                either internally or externally.
              </p>
              <p><a name="internal_stylesheets"></a></p>
              <h2>Internal Stylesheet</h2>
              <p>
                First we will explore the internal method. This way you are
                simply placing the CSS code within the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
                tags of each (X)HTML file you want to style with the CSS. The
                format for this is shown in the example below.
              </p>
              <p class="code">
                &lt;head&gt;<br />
                &lt;title&gt;&lt;title&gt;<br />
                &lt;style type=”text/css”&gt;<br />
                <em><span class="paths">CSS Content Goes Here</span></em
                ><br />
                &lt;/style&gt;<br />
                &lt;/head&gt;<br />
                &lt;body&gt;
              </p>
              <p>
                With this method each (X)HTML file contains the CSS code needed
                to style the page. Meaning that any changes you want to make to
                one page, will have to be made to all. This method can be good
                if you need to style only one page, or if you want different
                pages to have varying styles.
              </p>

              <p><a name="external_stylesheets"></a></p>
              <h2>External Stylesheet</h2>
              <p>
                Next we will explore the external method. An external CSS file
                can be created with any text or HTML editor such as “Notepad” or
                “Dreamweaver”. A CSS file contains no (X)HTML, only CSS. You
                simply save it with the .css file extension. You can link to the
                file externally by placing one of the following links in the
                head section of every (X)HTML file you want to style with the
                CSS file.
              </p>
              <p class="code">
                &lt;link rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css” href=<em
                  ><span class="paths">“Path To stylesheet.css”</span></em
                >
                /&gt;
              </p>
              <p>Or you can also use the @import method as shown below</p>
              <p class="code">
                &lt;style type=”text/css”&gt;@import url(<em
                  ><span class="paths">Path To stylesheet.css</span></em
                >)&lt;/style&gt;
              </p>
              <p>
                Either of these methods are achieved by placing one or the other
                in the head section as shown in example below.
              </p>
              <p class="code">
                &lt;head&gt;<br />
                &lt;title&gt;&lt;title&gt;<br />
                <em
                  ><span class="paths"
                    >&lt;link rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css”href=”../style.css”
                    /&gt;</span
                  ></em
                ><br />
                &lt;/head&gt;<br />
                &lt;body&gt;
              </p>
              <p>or</p>
              <p>
                &lt;head&gt;<br />
                &lt;title&gt;&lt;title&gt;<br />
                &lt;style type=”text/css”&gt;
                <em
                  ><span class="paths"
                    >@import url(<em
                      ><span class="paths">Path To stylesheet.css</span></em
                    >)</span
                  ></em
                >
                &lt;/style&gt;<br />
                &lt;/head&gt;<br />
                &lt;body&gt;
              </p>
              <p>
                By using an external style sheet, all of your (X)HTML files link
                to one CSS file in order to style the pages. This means, that if
                you need to alter the design of all your pages, you only need to
                edit one .css file to make global changes to your entire
                website.
              </p>
              <p>Here are a few reasons this is better.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Easier Maintenance</li>
                <li>Reduced File Size</li>
                <li>Reduced Bandwidth</li>
                <li>Improved Flexibility</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>Are you getting the idea? It’s really cool.</strong>
              </p>
              <p><a name="cascading_order"></a></p>
              <h2>Cascading Order</h2>
              <p>
                In the previous paragraphs, I have explained how to link to a
                css file either internally or externally. If you understood,
                than I am doing a good job. If not don’t fret, there is a long
                way to go before we are finished. Assuming you have caught on
                already, you are probably asking, well can I do both? The answer
                is yes. You can have both internal, external, and now wait a
                minute a third way? Yes inline styles also.
              </p>
              <p><a name="inline_styles"></a></p>
              <h3>Inline Styles</h3>
              <p>
                I have not mentioned them until now because in a way they defeat
                the purpose of using CSS in the first place. Inline styles are
                defined right in the (X)HTML file along side the element you
                want to style. See example below.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="code"
                  >&lt;p style=”color: #ff0000;”&gt;<em>Some red text</em
                  >&lt;/p&gt;</span
                >
              </p>
              <p style="color: #ff0000;">Some red text</p>
              <p>
                Inline styles will NOT allow the user to change styles of
                elements or text formatted this way
              </p>
              <p><a name="misc"></a></p>
              <p></p>

              <h3>So, which is better?</h3>
              <p>
                So with all these various ways of inserting CSS into your
                (X)HTML files, you may now be asking well which is better, and
                if I use more than one method, in what order do these different
                ways load into my browser?
              </p>
              <p>
                All the various methods will cascade into a new “pseudo”
                stylesheet in the following order:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Inline Style (inside (X)HTML element)</li>
                <li>Internal Style Sheet (inside the &lt;head&gt; tag)</li>
                <li>External Style Sheet</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                As far as which way is better, it depends on what you want to
                do. If you have only one file to style then placing it within
                the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tags (internal) will work fine.
                Though if you are planning on styling multiple files then the
                external file method is the way to go.
              </p>
              <p>
                Choosing between the &lt;link related=&gt; &amp; the @import
                methods are completely up to you. I will mention that the
                @import method may take a second longer to read the CSS file in
                Internet Explorer than the &lt;link related=&gt; option. To
                combat this see&nbsp;<a

              <h2>Users with Disabilities</h2>
              <p>
                The use of external style sheets also can benefit users that
                suffer from disabilities. For instance, a user can turn off your
                stylesheet or substitute one of there own to increase text size,
                change colors and so on. For more information on making your
                website accessible to all users please read

                >
              </p>
              <h2>Power Users</h2>
              <p>
                Swapping stylesheets is beneficial not only for users with
                disabilities, but also power users who are particular about how
                they read Web documents.
              </p>
              <h2>Browser Issues</h2>
              <p>
                You will discover as you delve farther into the world of CSS
                that all browsers are not created equally, to say the least. CSS
                can and will render differently in various browsers causing
                numerous headaches.
