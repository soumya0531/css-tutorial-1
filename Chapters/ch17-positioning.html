              <h2>Position</h2>
              <p>
                The position property (as you may have guessed) changes how
                elements are positioned on your webpage.
              </p>
              <p class="code">position: value;</p>
              <p>Values:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>static</li>
                <li>relative</li>
                <li>absolute</li>
                <li>fixed</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Now, what does all that mean?</strong></p>
              <h5>Static</h5>
              <p>
                Static positioning is by default the way an element will appear
                in the normal flow of your (X)HTML file. It is not necessary to
                declare a position of static. Doing so, is no different than not
                declaring it at all.
              </p>
              <p class="code">position: static;</p>

              <h5>Relative</h5>
              <p>
                Positioning an element relatively places the element in the
                normal flow of your (X)HTML file and then offsets it by some
                amount using the properties left, right, top and bottom. This
                may cause the element to overlap other elements that are on the
                page, which of course may be the effect that is required.
              </p>
              <p class="code">position: relative;</p>
              <h5>Absolute</h5>
              <p>
                Positioning an element absolutely, removes the element from the
                normal flow of your (X)HTML file, and positions it to the top
                left of its nearest parent element that has a position declared
                other than static. If no parent element with a position other
                than static exists then it will be positioned from the top left
                of the browser window.
              </p>
              <p class="code">position: absolute;</p>
              <h5>Fixed</h5>
              <p>
                Positioning an element with the fixed value, is the same as
                absolute except the parent element is always the browser window.
                It makes no difference if the fixed element is nested inside
                other positioned elements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, an element that is positioned with a fixed value,
                will not scroll with the document. It will remain in its
                position regardless of the scroll position of the page.
              </p>
              <p>
                At this time IE6 (Internet Explorer 6) does not support the
                fixed value for the positioning of an element. Thus it will not
                position fixed elements correctly and will still scroll with the
                page. To see this effect in action you will need to use a
                standards compliant browser, such as
                <a href="http://spreadfirefox.com/" title="Get a real browser"
                  >Firefox 1.0</a
                >
              </p>
              <p class="code">position: fixed;</p>
              <p>
                When positioning elements with relative, absolute or fixed
                values the following properties are used to offset the element:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>top</li>
                <li>left</li>
                <li>right</li>
                <li>bottom</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="code">position: absolute; top: 10px; right: 10px;</p>
            </div>
          </article>
        </main>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
