              <p>
                The syntax for CSS is different than that of (X)HTML markup.
                Though it is not too confusing, once you take a look at it. It
                consists of only 3 parts.
              </p>
              <p class="code">selector { property: value }</p>
              <p>
                The selector is the (X)HTML element that you want to style. The
                property is the actual property title, and the value is the
                style you apply to that property.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each selector can have multiple properties, and each property
                within that selector can have independent values. The property
                and value are separated with a colon and contained within curly
                brackets. Multiple properties are separated by a semi colon.
                Multiple values within a property are sperated by commas, and if
                an individual value contains more than one word you surround it
                with quotation marks. As shown below.
              </p>
              <p class="code">
                body {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;background: #eeeeee;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family:
                “Trebuchet MS”, Verdana, Arial, serif;<br />}
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can see in the above code I have separated the color from
                the font-family with a semi-colon, separated the various fonts
                with commas and contained the “Trebuchet MS” within quotations
                marks. The final result sets the body color to light grey, and
                sets the font to ones that most users will have installed on
                there computer.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have changed the way I layout my code, but you can arrange it
                in one line if you choose. I find that it is more readable if I
                spread each property to a separate line, with a 2 space
                indention.
              </p>

              <p><a name="inheritance"></a></p>
              <h2>Inheritance</h2>
              <p>
                When you nest one element inside another, the nested element
                will inherit the properties assigned to the containing element.
                Unless you modify the inner elements values independently.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, a font declared in the body will be inherited by
                all text in the file no matter the containing element, unless
                you declare another font for a specific nested element.
              </p>
              <p class="code">body {font-family: Verdana, serif;}</p>
              <p>
                Now all text within the (X)HTML file will be set to Verdana.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you wanted to style certain text with another font, like an
                h1 or a paragraph then you could do the following.
              </p>
              <p class="code">
                h1 {font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;}<br />p {font-family:
                Tahoma, serif;}
              </p>
              <p>
                Now all &lt;h1&gt; tags within the file will be set to Georgia
                and all &lt;p&gt; tags are set to Tahoma, leaving text within
                other elements unchanged from the body declaration of Verdana.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are instances where nested elements do not inherit the
                containing elements properties.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if the body margin is set to 20 pixels, the other
                elements within the file will not inherit the body margin by
                default.
              </p>
              <p class="code">body {margin: 20px;}</p>
              <p><a name="combining_selectors"></a></p>
              <h2>Combining Selectors</h2>
              <p>
                You can combine elements within one selector in the following
                fashion.
              </p>
              <p class="code">
                h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;color: #009900;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family:
                Georgia, sans-serif;<br />}
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can see in the above code, I have grouped all the header
                elements into one selector. Each one is separated by a comma.
                The final result of the above code sets all headers to green and
                to the specified font. If the user does not have the first font
                I declared it will go to another sans-serif font the user has
                installed on their computer.
              </p>
              <p><a name="comment_tags"></a></p>
              <h2>Comment tags</h2>
              <p>
                Comments can be used to explain why you added certain selectors
                within your css file. So as to help others who may see your
                file, or to help you remember what you we’re thinking at a later
                date. You can add comments that will be ignored by browsers in
                the following manner.
              </p>
              <p class="code">/* This is a comment */</p>
              <p>
                You will note that it begins with a / (forward slash) and than
                an * (asterisks) then the comment, then the closing tag which is
                just backward from the opening tag * (asterisks) then the /
                (forward slash).
              </p>
