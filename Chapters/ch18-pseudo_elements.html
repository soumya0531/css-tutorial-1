              <h2>The Syntax</h2>
              <p>
                The syntax for pseudo elements is a bit different than that of
                regular CSS, but it’s real close. If you have already read
                <a
                  href="ch11-anchors_links_pseudoClasses.html"
                  title="Chapter 11 - CSS Anchors, links and pseudo classes"
                  >chapter 11</a
                >
                then you are slightly ahead of the game.
              </p>
              <p class="code">
                selector:<span class="paths">pseudo-element</span> {property:
                value}
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can see the only difference is that you place the pseudo
                element after the selector, and divide the 2 with a (:) colon.
              </p>
              <p>Or you can assign a class to a pseudo element as follows</p>
              <p class="code">
                selector.<span class="paths">p</span>:pseudo-element {property:
                value}
              </p>
              <p>
                Using the above code would style all paragraphs within the
                declared selector with the pseudo element.
              </p>
              <h2>The elements:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>first-line</li>
                <li>first-letter</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>First Line</h2>
              <p>
                The first-line pseudo element styles the first line of text in a
                block level element.
              </p>
              <p class="code">
                p{font-size: small;}<br />p:<span class="paths"
                  >first-line</span
                >
                {font-size: medium; color: #ff0000;}
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can see in the above example paragraphs are set to be a
                small font size, but the p:first-line is set to be a medium size
                and a red color. The result is that the first line of all
                paragraphs will be red in color and a bit larger than the rest
                of the paragraph.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though lets say you only want to style a certain paragraph of
                text with the first-line element. Thats where declaring a class
                to the pseudo element comes into play.
              </p>
              <h5>first-line with class</h5>
              <p class="code">
                p<span class="paths">.special</span>:first-line {font-size:
                medium; color: #ff0000;}
              </p>
              <p>I have declared a class of special within my css file.</p>
              <p><strong>First-Line Example</strong></p>
              <p class="special">
                This is a special sentence I wrote to demonstrate the use and
                look of the first-line pseudo element. As you can see the first
                line of this paragraph is styled differently than the rest of
                the text within it. All of this was done by simply adding
                class=”special” to the opening &lt;p&gt; tag for this paragraph.
              </p>
              <p class="code">
                &lt;p <span class="paths">class=”special”&gt;</span>the
                content&lt;/p&gt;
              </p>
              <p>
                Where the first-line ends depends on the width of the browser
                window or containing element, you can resize this page and see
                that it adjusts as you change the size of the browser window.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following properties can be assigned to the first-line
                pseudo element:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>background</li>
                <li>clear</li>
                <li>color</li>
                <li>font</li>
                <li>letter-spacing</li>
                <li>line-height</li>
                <li>text-decoration</li>
                <li>text-transform</li>
                <li>vertical-align</li>
                <li>word-spacing</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>First Letter</h2>
              <p>
                The first-letter pseudo element styles the first letter of text
                in a block level element.
              </p>
              <p class="code">
                p{font-size: small;}<br />p:<span class="paths"
                  >first-letter</span
                >
                {font-size: medium; color: #ff0000;}
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can see in the above example paragraphs are set to be a
                small font size, but the p:first-letter is set to be a medium
                size and a red color. The result is that the first letter of all
                paragraphs will be red in color and a bit larger than the rest
                of the paragraph.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though lets say you only want to style a certain paragraph of
                text with the first-letter element. Thats where declaring a
                class to the pseudo element comes into play.

              </p>
              <p>
                I have declared a class of special_letter within my css file.
